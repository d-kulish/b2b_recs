## Key Technical Decisions (2024-12-14)

| Decision | Choice |
|----------|--------|
| Pipeline Framework | **Native TFX SDK** (NOT KFP v2 placeholder) |
| Data Flow | BigQuery → TFRecords → TFX |
| Container Image | `gcr.io/tfx-oss-public/tfx:latest` |
| TensorBoard | **NOT USED** (too expensive) - custom visualizations |
| Pipeline Compilation | On-demand at submission time |
| Sampling | TFX-level (ExampleGen/Transform) |
| Train/Val Split | 3 options: random (hash-based), time_holdout (date-filtered + hash), strict_time (true temporal) |
| Model Type | Retrieval and Ranking (see [ranking_implementation.md](ranking_implementation.md)) |

---

## Recent Updates (December 2025 - January 2026)

### Ranking Model Support with Target Column Transforms (2026-01-07)

**Major Feature:** Added full support for Ranking models alongside existing Retrieval models.

#### Overview

| Aspect | Retrieval | Ranking |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Purpose** | Find candidate items | Score/rank candidates |
| **Architecture** | Two-tower → dot product | Two-tower → concat → rating head → scalar |
| **TFRS Task** | `tfrs.tasks.Retrieval()` | `tfrs.tasks.Ranking()` |
| **Label** | None (implicit) | Target column (explicit) |
| **Metrics** | Recall@K | RMSE, MAE |

#### Target Column Transforms

When a target column is set in Feature Config, three optional transforms can be applied:

| Transform | Purpose | Implementation |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Clip Outliers** | Cap extreme values | `tft.quantiles()` for true percentile computation |
| **Log Transform** | Compress skewed distributions | `tf.math.log1p()` |
| **Normalize** | Scale to 0-1 range | `tft.scale_to_0_1()` |

**Transform Order:** Clip → Log → Normalize

**Bug Fix:** Previously, "Clip at 99th percentile" incorrectly computed `max * 0.99`. Now uses `tft.quantiles(num_buckets=1000)` for true percentile values.

#### Inverse Transform at Serving

Ranking models now return predictions in **original scale** (not normalized):

```python
return {
    'predictions': predictions_original,       # e.g., $1.83
    'predictions_normalized': predictions_normalized  # e.g., 0.15
}
```

A `transform_params.json` file is saved with each model containing normalization parameters.

#### Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `ml_platform/configs/services.py` | `_generate_target_column_code()`, `_generate_serve_fn_ranking()`, `_generate_run_fn_ranking()` |
| `templates/ml_platform/model_configs.html` | New clip UI with lower/upper percentile selectors |
| `docs/ranking_implementation.md` | Updated schema, transform examples, inverse transform section |

**See:** [ranking_implementation.md](ranking_implementation.md) for full implementation details.

### Experiment Wizard - Model Type Selection & Rating Head Display (2026-01-07)

**Enhancement:** Improved the New Experiment wizard with model type selection and full ranking model support.

#### Model Type Selection

Added model type selector as the first element in the wizard (Step 1: Select Configs):

| Model Type | Icon | Description | Compatible Feature Configs |
|------------|------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Retrieval** | 🔍 Purple | Two-tower for candidate retrieval | `config_type='retrieval'` (no target column) |
| **Ranking** | 📊 Amber | Score and rank candidates | `config_type='ranking'` (has target column) |
| **Multitask** | 🔀 Pink | Combined retrieval + ranking | `config_type='ranking'` (has target column) |

**Behavior:**
- Default selection: Retrieval
- Feature Config dropdown filters based on selected model type
- Model Config dropdown filters to show only configs of selected type
- Changing model type resets both config selections

#### Target Column Display

For ranking/multitask model types, the Feature Config preview now shows the target column:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ◎ Target Column                    For Ranking  │
│ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ sales   FLOAT                               │ │
│ └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │
│ [Normalize 0-1] [Log transform] [Clip 1%-99%]   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Shows:
- Column name and BigQuery type
- Applied transforms as tags (Normalize, Log transform, Clip percentiles)

#### Rating Head Display

For ranking/multitask model configs, the Model Config preview now shows the Rating Head network:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ⭐ Rating Head                      128→64→32→1 │
│ ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ DENSE  128 units, relu                      │ │
│ │ DENSE  64 units, relu                       │ │
│ │ DENSE  32 units, relu                       │ │
│ │ DENSE  1 units (output)                     │ │
│ └─────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │
│ Total params: 12,609                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Color Theme:** Purple/magenta (#d946ef) to match Model Config wizard styling.

#### Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `templates/ml_platform/model_experiments.html` | Model type selector, target column display, rating head display |
| `templates/ml_platform/model_configs.html` | Compact horizontal model type buttons |

#### CSS Classes Added

| Class | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `.wizard-model-type-selector` | Grid layout for model type buttons |
| `.wizard-model-type-option` | Individual button with icon + text |
| `.target-column-card` | Amber-themed target column display |
| `.wizard-rating-head-section` | Purple-themed rating head display |

---

### Transform Vocabulary Coverage Fix (2026-01-05)

**Critical Fix:** Ensured vocabulary is computed from ALL data (train + eval), not just train split.

#### The Problem

With hash-based 80/20 train/eval split in `BigQueryExampleGen`, the `Transform` component by default computes vocabularies (`tft.compute_and_apply_vocabulary()`) from **only the train split**. This caused:

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| IDs appearing only in eval | Mapped to OOV (out-of-vocabulary) embedding |
| ~20% of unique IDs potentially affected | Lost embedding coverage in evaluation |
| Cold start customers/products | Couldn't be properly evaluated |

For TFRS two-tower models, this means customers/products that randomly landed entirely in the eval split (due to hash-based splitting) would share a single OOV embedding, degrading evaluation metrics.

#### The Solution

Added `splits_config` to the Transform component to analyze **both** train and eval splits when building vocabularies:

```python
from tfx.proto import transform_pb2

transform = Transform(
    examples=example_gen.outputs['examples'],
    schema=schema_gen.outputs['schema'],
    module_file=transform_module_path,
    splits_config=transform_pb2.SplitsConfig(
        analyze=['train', 'eval'],  # Build vocab from ALL data
        transform=['train', 'eval']  # Apply transforms to both splits
    ),
)
```

#### Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `cloudbuild/compile_and_submit.py` | Added `transform_pb2` import, added `splits_config` to Transform |
| `ml_platform/experiments/tfx_pipeline.py` | Same changes for consistency |

#### Result

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Vocab from train only (~80% of IDs) | Vocab from all data (100% of IDs) |
| Eval-only IDs → OOV | All IDs have vocab entries |
| Incomplete embedding coverage | Complete embedding coverage |

---

### Training Analysis Heatmaps - Layout & R@5 Metric (2026-01-05)

**Enhancement:** Fixed Training Analysis heatmaps layout and added missing Recall@5 metric.

#### Problems Fixed

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Layout dislocation** | Heatmaps now use 60%/40% split (Loss 60%, Recall 40%) |
| **Missing R@5 metric** | Added `recall_at_5` field and displays all 4 recall metrics |
| **Broken metric extraction** | Fixed `_extract_results()` to use correct file and keys |
| **NULL direct fields** | Backfilled all recall metrics from `training_history_json` |

#### Root Cause Analysis

The `_extract_results()` function was broken:
- **Wrong file**: Looked for `metrics.json` but trainer saves `training_metrics.json`
- **Wrong keys**: Expected `factorized_top_k/top_*` but trainer uses `test_recall_at_*`
- **Missing field**: QuickTest model lacked `recall_at_5` field

Data was available in `training_history_json['final_metrics']` but not extracted to direct DB fields.

#### Changes

| Component | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Heatmap layout** | Both panels `flex: 1` (50%/50%) | Loss `flex: 6` (60%), Recall `flex: 4` (40%) |
| **Recall metrics** | `['R@10', 'R@50', 'R@100']` | `['R@5', 'R@10', 'R@50', 'R@100']` |
| **Cell sizing** | Fixed `cellWidth = 55px` | Responsive to container width |
| **Metric extraction** | `metrics.json` with wrong keys | `training_metrics.json` with `test_recall_at_*` |

#### Database Migration

```python
# ml_platform/models.py - QuickTest model
recall_at_5 = models.FloatField(null=True, blank=True, help_text="Recall@5 metric")
```

Migration: `0047_add_recall_at_5_to_quicktest.py`

#### Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `ml_platform/models.py` | Added `recall_at_5` field |
| `ml_platform/experiments/services.py` | Fixed `_extract_results()` - correct file/keys, extract R@5 |
| `ml_platform/experiments/api.py` | Added R@5 to `training_heatmaps()` response |
| `templates/ml_platform/model_experiments.html` | CSS 60%/40% layout, JS 4 metrics + responsive sizing |

#### New Management Command

```bash
# Backfill recall metrics from training_history_json to direct DB fields
python manage.py backfill_recall_metrics

# Options
python manage.py backfill_recall_metrics --dry-run   # Preview changes
python manage.py backfill_recall_metrics --limit 10  # Process only 10 records
python manage.py backfill_recall_metrics --force     # Re-populate even if fields have values
```

### Hyperparameter Insights - Enhanced Layout & Feature Details (2026-01-05)

**Major Enhancement:** Improved Model Architecture and Features sections with 2-row Buyer/Product layouts and new Feature Details analysis.

#### Changes

| Component | Change |
|-----------|--------|
| **Model Architecture** | 2-row layout (Buyer row / Product row) for easy comparison |
| **Tower Cards** | Double-width for full structure display (e.g., "256→128→64→32") |
| **Activation Cards** | Removed (activation varies per layer, not useful) |
| **Features Section** | 2-row layout with summary + detail cards |
| **Tensor Dim** | Renamed to "Vector Size" |
| **Feature Details** | NEW: Shows which features (by name + dim) correlate with best results |
| **Cross Details** | NEW: Same analysis for cross features |

#### New Fields Added

```python
# ml_platform/models.py - QuickTest model
buyer_feature_details = JSONField()    # [{"name": "customer_id", "dim": 32}, ...]
product_feature_details = JSONField()
buyer_cross_details = JSONField()
product_cross_details = JSONField()
```

#### Bug Fix

Fixed `_calc_feature_dim()` in `FeatureConfig.calculate_tensor_dims()`:
- **Issue**: Text features with `transforms.embedding.enabled` returned dim=0
- **Cause**: Only checked legacy `feature.type == 'string_embedding'`
- **Fix**: Added check for `transforms.embedding.embedding_dim`
- **Impact**: `product_tensor_dim` was 0 for all configs with text-only features

#### Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `ml_platform/models.py` | 4 new JSONFields, fixed `_calc_feature_dim()` |
| `ml_platform/migrations/0044_add_feature_details_fields.py` | New migration |
| `ml_platform/experiments/services.py` | Extract feature details at creation |
| `ml_platform/experiments/hyperparameter_analyzer.py` | New `_analyze_feature_details()`, renamed labels |
| `ml_platform/management/commands/backfill_hyperparameter_fields.py` | Added feature details extraction |
| `templates/ml_platform/model_experiments.html` | New UI layout, CSS, JS |

**See:** [`hyperparameter_best_selection.md`](hyperparameter_best_selection.md) for full details.

### Hyperparameter Insights - Dataset Filters Analysis (2026-01-05)

**New Feature:** Added Dataset section to Hyperparameter Insights showing TPE analysis for dataset configurations.

#### Overview

The Dataset section analyzes which dataset configurations (size, date filters, customer filters, product filters) correlate with better model performance. This helps users understand:
- Optimal dataset sizes for training
- Which date ranges work best
- Impact of customer/product filtering strategies

#### Layout

Single row with 4 tablets:

| Tablet | Content | Example Values |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| **Dataset Size** | Row counts | 782K, 108K |
| **Dates** | Date filter settings | "Rolling 90 days", "Rolling 60 days" |
| **Customer Filters** | Customer filtering | "city = CHERNIGIV", "Transaction count > 2" |
| **Product Filters** | Product filtering | "Top 80% products", "Top 70% products" |

Each tablet shows top 5 values sorted by TPE score with experiment counts.

#### New Fields Added

```python
# ml_platform/models.py - QuickTest model
dataset_date_filters = JSONField()      # ["Rolling 90 days"]
dataset_customer_filters = JSONField()  # ["city = CHERNIGIV", "Transaction count > 2"]
dataset_product_filters = JSONField()   # ["Top 80% products"]
```

#### Filter Description Extraction

Filters are extracted from `Dataset.filters` JSONField and converted to human-readable descriptions:

| Filter Type | Source Field | Example Output |
|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Date rolling | `history.rolling_days` | "Rolling 60 days" |
| Date fixed | `history.start_date` | "From 2024-01-01" |
| Customer top revenue | `customer_filter.top_revenue.percent` | "Top 80% customers" |
| Customer aggregation | `customer_filter.aggregation_filters` | "Transaction count > 2" |
| Customer category | `customer_filter.category_filters` | "city = CHERNIGIV" |
| Product top revenue | `product_filter.top_revenue.threshold_percent` | "Top 70% products" |
| Product category | `product_filter.category_filters` | "category = Books, Home Decor" |

#### Row Count Source

Dataset row count is extracted from:
1. `Dataset.row_count_estimate` (preferred)
2. `Dataset.summary_snapshot['total_rows']` (fallback)

#### Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `ml_platform/models.py` | 3 new JSONFields for filter descriptions |
| `ml_platform/migrations/0045_*.py` | Initial filter fields (superseded) |
| `ml_platform/migrations/0046_*.py` | Final JSON filter fields |
| `ml_platform/experiments/services.py` | Filter description extraction methods |
| `ml_platform/experiments/hyperparameter_analyzer.py` | New `_analyze_filter_details()`, `FILTER_FIELDS` |
| `ml_platform/management/commands/backfill_hyperparameter_fields.py` | Filter description extraction |
| `templates/ml_platform/model_experiments.html` | Dataset section UI, `renderFilterDetailCard()` |

### MLflow Removed - Direct GCS Storage (2026-01-02)

**Major Change:** MLflow has been completely removed from the training pipeline and replaced with direct GCS storage.

#### Why MLflow Was Removed

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Infrastructure overhead | Separate Cloud Run + Cloud SQL (~$50/month) |
| Cold start latency | 5-15 seconds before trainer could log metrics |
| 7,000+ API calls per training | Each metric logged via HTTP POST |
| No real value | MLflow UI was never used; caching solved query performance |

#### New Architecture

```
BEFORE (MLflow):
Trainer → MLflowRestClient → MLflow Server (Cloud Run) → PostgreSQL
                              ↓
Django → MLflowService → MLflow Server → PostgreSQL → UI

AFTER (GCS):
Trainer → MetricsCollector (in-memory) → training_metrics.json (GCS)
                              ↓
Django → TrainingCacheService → GCS file → training_history_json (DB) → UI
```

#### Implementation

**Trainer Side (`ml_platform/configs/services.py`):**
- `MLflowRestClient` → `MetricsCollector` (in-memory collection)
- `MLflowCallback` → `MetricsCallback`
- Training completion: `_metrics_collector.save_to_gcs()` writes `training_metrics.json`

**Django Side (`ml_platform/experiments/training_cache_service.py`):**
- Reads `training_metrics.json` from GCS
- Caches in `QuickTest.training_history_json` for instant access

#### Backward Compatibility

Historical experiments with `mlflow_run_id` are supported through cached data:
1. All 12 experiments with MLflow run IDs were pre-cached in `training_history_json`
2. `mlflow_service.py` has been **DELETED** (MLflow server is gone)
3. DB fields `mlflow_run_id` and `mlflow_experiment_name` retained for reference only

#### Completed Steps (2026-01-02)

| Step | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Run backfill | ✅ Done | All 12 historical experiments cached |
| Test new experiment | ✅ Done | Custom Job test verified `training_metrics.json` creation |
| Delete MLflow infrastructure | ✅ Done | See deleted resources below |

#### Deleted GCP Resources

| Resource | Type |
|----------|------|
| `mlflow-server` | Cloud Run Service |
| `mlflow-server@b2b-recs.iam.gserviceaccount.com` | Service Account |
| `mlflow-db-uri` | Secret Manager Secret |
| `gs://b2b-recs-mlflow-artifacts/` | GCS Bucket |

#### Deleted Code Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `mlflow_server/` | MLflow server deployment |
| `ml_platform/experiments/mlflow_service.py` | Django MLflow client |
| `tests/test_mlflow_integration.py` | MLflow integration tests |
| `scripts/run_trainer_only.py` | Old test script |

**Documentation:**
- See `docs/mlflow.md` for archived MLflow implementation reference
- See `docs/mlflow_out.md` for migration plan details

### Training History Caching - Performance Optimization (2026-01-02)

**Major Enhancement:** Training tab now loads in <1 second (down from 2-3 minutes) by caching training history in Django DB.

#### The Problem

Loading training data for a single experiment took 2-3 minutes due to:

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| MLflow server cold start | 5-15 seconds if Cloud Run scaled to zero |
| N+1 API calls | 50+ sequential HTTP requests to fetch each metric's history |
| Large data volume | 7,000+ data points per experiment (140 metrics × 50 epochs) |
| No caching | Every view fetched full history from MLflow database |

This made experiment comparison impractical - comparing 10 experiments would take 20-30 minutes.

#### The Solution

Cache training history in Django DB as a JSONField on the QuickTest model:

```
BEFORE:
UI Request → Django → MLflow Server (50+ API calls) → PostgreSQL → Response (2-3 min)

AFTER:
UI Request → Django → QuickTest.training_history_json → Response (<1 sec)
```

**Key Design Decisions:**

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Cache location | Django DB (JSONField) | No additional infrastructure (Redis, etc.) |
| Epoch sampling | Every 5th epoch | Reduces cache size while preserving trends |
| Histogram data | Fetched on-demand | Large data, rarely needed |
| Cache trigger | At training completion | One-time cost, instant subsequent loads |

#### Implementation

**Files Changed:**

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `ml_platform/models.py` | Added `training_history_json` JSONField |
| `ml_platform/experiments/training_cache_service.py` | **NEW** - TrainingCacheService class |
| `ml_platform/experiments/services.py` | Triggers cache at completion |
| `ml_platform/experiments/api.py` | Uses cache, added histogram endpoint |
| `ml_platform/experiments/mlflow_service.py` | Added `get_histogram_data()` |
| `ml_platform/management/commands/backfill_training_cache.py` | **NEW** - backfill command |

**Cached Data Structure (~7KB per experiment):**

```python
{
    "cached_at": "2026-01-02T10:30:00Z",
    "mlflow_run_id": "abc123...",
    "epochs": [0, 5, 10, 15, ...],  # Sampled
    "loss": {"train": [...], "val": [...], "total": [...]},
    "gradient_norms": {"total": [...], "query": [...], "candidate": [...]},
    "final_metrics": {"test_recall_at_100": 0.075, ...},
    "params": {"epochs": 50, "batch_size": 2048, ...},
    "histogram_available": true  # Fetched on-demand
}
```

#### Results

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Training tab load time | 2-3 minutes | <1 second |
| Compare 10 experiments | 20-30 minutes | <5 seconds |
| MLflow API calls per view | 50+ | 0 (from cache) |
| Cache size per experiment | N/A | ~7 KB |

#### Backfilling Existing Experiments

```bash
# Dry run
python manage.py backfill_training_cache --dry-run

# Backfill all completed experiments
python manage.py backfill_training_cache

# Backfill in batches
python manage.py backfill_training_cache --limit 10
```

#### MLflow Status After This Change (UPDATED 2026-01-02)

~~MLflow is now only used for:~~
~~1. **Trainer logging** - during training (unchanged)~~
~~2. **One-time cache population** - at completion or first view~~
~~3. **Histogram data** - on-demand via `/api/quick-tests/<id>/histogram-data/`~~

~~The UI no longer requires MLflow for normal operation once data is cached.~~

~~**Future option:** Eliminate MLflow entirely by having trainer write to GCS instead.~~

**UPDATE:** MLflow has been completely removed. See [MLflow Removed - Direct GCS Storage](#mlflow-removed---direct-gcs-storage-2026-01-02) above.

### Cancel Button Bug Fix for Compile Phase (2025-12-30)

**Bug Fix:** Cancel button now properly cancels experiments during the Compile (Cloud Build) phase.

#### The Problem

The Cancel button only worked when experiments were in the RUNNING phase (Vertex AI pipeline execution). When cancelling during the SUBMITTING phase (Compile), the following occurred:

1. **Database updated** - Status changed to "cancelled" ✓
2. **Cloud Build continued** - Compilation kept running ✗
3. **Pipeline submitted** - Vertex AI pipeline was submitted after Cloud Build completed ✗
4. **Resources wasted** - Orphaned pipeline consumed compute resources ✗

**Root Cause:** The `cancel_quick_test()` method in `services.py` only handled Vertex AI pipeline cancellation. When `vertex_pipeline_job_name` was empty (during Compile phase), it returned early without cancelling Cloud Build.

#### Two-Phase Execution Architecture

```
SUBMITTING ─── Cloud Build Phase (1-2 min)
    │           └─ Compiles TFX pipeline, submits to Vertex AI
    │           └─ cloud_build_id stored, vertex_pipeline_job_name NOT YET available
    ▼
RUNNING ────── Vertex AI Pipeline Phase (5-15 min)
    │           └─ Examples → Stats → Schema → Transform → Train
    │           └─ vertex_pipeline_job_name now available
    ▼
COMPLETED/FAILED/CANCELLED
```

#### The Fix

Updated `cancel_quick_test()` in `ml_platform/experiments/services.py` to handle both phases:

| Phase | Condition | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Compile | `cloud_build_id` exists, no `vertex_pipeline_job_name` | Cancel via `cloudbuild_v1.CloudBuildClient().cancel_build()` |
| Pipeline | `vertex_pipeline_job_name` exists | Cancel via `aiplatform.PipelineJob.cancel()` |
| Race condition | Cloud Build completes during cancel | Check for result, then cancel Vertex pipeline if submitted |

**Key Changes:**
- Added Cloud Build cancellation using `google.cloud.devtools.cloudbuild_v1`
- Handle race condition where Cloud Build completes between cancel request and API call
- Comprehensive logging for debugging which phase was cancelled

---

### Delete Experiment Functionality (2026-01-04)

**New Feature:** Added ability to permanently delete experiments and their associated GCS artifacts.

#### The Problem

Experiments could only be cancelled but never deleted. Failed or useless experiments accumulated in the database and UI, making it harder to manage and find relevant experiments.

#### The Solution

Added a delete button to experiment cards that permanently removes:
1. **Database record** - QuickTest record deleted from Django DB
2. **GCS artifacts** - All files under `gcs_artifacts_path` deleted from Cloud Storage

#### UI Implementation

**Button Layout:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  [View]  [Cancel]               │  ← Row 1: View and Cancel side by side
│                 [🗑️]            │  ← Row 2: Delete button aligned right
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Button States:**
| Status | View | Cancel | Delete |
|--------|------|--------|--------|
| Running/Submitting | Enabled | Enabled | Disabled |
| Completed/Failed/Cancelled | Enabled | Disabled | Enabled |

**Confirmation Modal:**
- Title: "Delete Experiment"
- Message: Warning about permanent deletion
- Buttons: "Ok" (green) to confirm, "Cancel" (red) to abort

#### API Endpoint

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| DELETE | `/api/quick-tests/<id>/delete/` | Delete experiment and GCS artifacts |

**Response:**
```json
{"success": true, "message": "Experiment deleted successfully"}
```

**Error (if running):**
```json
{"success": false, "error": "Cannot delete experiment in 'running' state. Please cancel the experiment first."}
```

#### Implementation Files

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `ml_platform/experiments/services.py` | Added `delete_quick_test()` and `_delete_gcs_artifacts()` methods |
| `ml_platform/experiments/api.py` | Added `quick_test_delete()` endpoint |
| `ml_platform/experiments/urls.py` | Added URL route for delete endpoint |
| `templates/ml_platform/model_experiments.html` | Added delete button, JS handler, CSS for button layout |
| `static/css/cards.css` | Added disabled state for delete button |

#### Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| GCS artifacts | Delete with record | Save storage costs, data is recoverable from re-running |
| Vertex AI job | Keep | Preserve audit trail in GCP |
| Running experiments | Block delete | Must cancel first to prevent orphaned resources |
| Confirmation | Single modal | Balance safety with UX friction |

### Weight Distribution Histogram - Ridgeline Chart (2025-12-30, Updated 2025-12-31)

**Major Enhancement:** Added TensorBoard-style ridgeline plot for weight distribution visualization in the Training tab using D3.js.

#### The Problem

The existing Weight Distribution chart showed only summary statistics (mean, std, min, max) as line charts. While useful, this didn't show the full distribution of weights - making it difficult to:
- See if weights are normally distributed or skewed
- Detect bimodal distributions
- Visualize how the entire distribution evolves over training (not just extremes)

TensorBoard's weight histogram visualization solves this by showing stacked "ridge" distributions per epoch, but TensorBoard is expensive and requires separate infrastructure.

#### The Solution

Implemented a ridgeline plot (also known as joyplot) using D3.js that mimics TensorBoard's weight histogram visualization. This approach uses SVG for reliable rendering and follows the D3 Graph Gallery ridgeline pattern.

**Data Collection (Trainer Callback):**

```python
class WeightStatsCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    NUM_HISTOGRAM_BINS = 25

    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        # ... existing mean/std/min/max logging ...

        # Histogram bins
        counts, bin_edges = np.histogram(weights_arr, bins=self.NUM_HISTOGRAM_BINS)

        # Log bin edges once (epoch 0 only) as parameter
        if epoch == 0:
            edges_str = ','.join([f'{e:.6f}' for e in bin_edges])
            _mlflow_client.log_param(f'{tower}_hist_bin_edges', edges_str)

        # Log bin counts per epoch as metrics
        for i, count in enumerate(counts):
            _mlflow_client.log_metric(f'{tower}_hist_bin_{i}', int(count), step=epoch)
```

**New Metrics Logged:**

| Metric | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `{tower}_hist_bin_edges` | Parameter | Comma-separated bin edges (26 values for 25 bins) |
| `{tower}_hist_bin_0` ... `{tower}_hist_bin_24` | Metric (per epoch) | Count of weights in each bin |

**Visualization:**

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Chart Features:**
- **D3.js Ridgeline Plot**: SVG-based visualization with smooth curves (`d3.curveBasis`)
- **Two Y Scales**: `yDensity` for ridge height, `yEpoch` (scaleBand) for vertical positioning
- **Color Gradient**: Light orange (#fdd4b3) for older epochs → Dark orange (#e25822) for newer epochs
- **Tower Selector**: Dropdown in header row to switch between Query and Candidate tower
- **Responsive**: Adapts to container width using `getBoundingClientRect()`
- **Epoch Labels**: Step numbers displayed on the right side

**Implementation Details:**
- Uses D3.js v7 (`d3.area()` with `curveBasis` for smooth curves)
- Each ridge is positioned using SVG transforms based on `scaleBand`
- Ridges drawn back-to-front (oldest first) so newer epochs overlap older ones
- Container height: 300px with 10px top margin, 40px bottom margin

#### Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `ml_platform/configs/services.py` | Added histogram logging to `WeightStatsCallback` |
| `ml_platform/experiments/mlflow_service.py` | Added histogram parsing in `get_training_history()` |
| `templates/ml_platform/model_experiments.html` | Added D3.js v7, ridgeline chart with SVG rendering |

#### Data Structure

**MLflow Service returns:**

```python
'weight_stats': {
    'query': {
        'mean': [...],
        'std': [...],
        'min': [...],
        'max': [...],
        'histogram': {
            'bin_edges': [-0.31, -0.28, ..., 0.28, 0.31],  # 26 edges
            'counts': [
                [5, 120, 890, ...],   # epoch 0: 25 counts
                [4, 115, 920, ...],   # epoch 1: 25 counts
                ...
            ]
        }
    },
    'candidate': { ... }
}
```

#### Backward Compatibility

- **Existing experiments**: Show "Histogram data not available for this experiment" placeholder
- **New experiments**: Collect and display full histogram data
- **Existing charts**: Weight Distribution (mean/std/min/max) chart preserved alongside new 3D chart

#### Interpretation Guide

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Distribution narrows over epochs | Weights converging (good) |
| Distribution spreads out | Weights diverging (potential overfitting) |
| Distribution shifts left/right | Systematic bias developing |
| Multiple peaks (bimodal) | May indicate separate weight populations |
| Flat distribution | Weights not learning structure |

### Gradient Distribution Histogram (2025-12-31)

**Major Enhancement:** Added gradient distribution visualization alongside weight distribution in the Training tab, enabling diagnosis of vanishing/exploding gradients.

#### The Problem

The existing weight distribution histogram showed how weights evolve during training, but didn't capture gradient dynamics. Without gradient visibility, it's difficult to diagnose:
- Vanishing gradients (distribution collapsing to zero)
- Exploding gradients (distribution spreading wildly)
- Dead neurons (spike at exactly zero)
- Layer-specific training issues

#### The Solution

Extended the training pipeline to capture gradient statistics using a custom `train_step` override and new `GradientStatsCallback`. The UI now supports switching between weight and gradient histograms.

**Custom train_step (RetrievalModel):**

```python
def train_step(self, data):
    """Custom train_step that captures gradient statistics."""
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        loss = self.compute_loss(data, training=True)
        total_loss = loss + sum(self.losses)

    gradients = tape.gradient(total_loss, self.trainable_variables)
    self.optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, self.trainable_variables))

    # Store gradient samples for histogram (sampled to limit memory)
    for grad, var in zip(gradients, self.trainable_variables):
        if grad is not None:
            var_name = var.name.lower()
            grad_sample = ...  # Sample up to 10,000 values per variable
            if 'query' in var_name or 'buyer' in var_name:
                self._gradient_stats['query'].append(grad_sample.numpy())
            elif 'candidate' in var_name or 'product' in var_name:
                self._gradient_stats['candidate'].append(grad_sample.numpy())

    return dict(loss=loss, total_loss=total_loss)
```

**GradientStatsCallback:**

```python
class GradientStatsCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
    NUM_HISTOGRAM_BINS = 25

    def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs=None):
        for tower in ['query', 'candidate']:
            grads = self.model._gradient_stats.get(tower, [])
            all_grads = np.concatenate(grads)

            # Summary statistics
            _mlflow_client.log_metric(f'{tower}_grad_mean', np.mean(all_grads), step=epoch)
            _mlflow_client.log_metric(f'{tower}_grad_std', np.std(all_grads), step=epoch)
            _mlflow_client.log_metric(f'{tower}_grad_min', np.min(all_grads), step=epoch)
            _mlflow_client.log_metric(f'{tower}_grad_max', np.max(all_grads), step=epoch)
            _mlflow_client.log_metric(f'{tower}_grad_norm', np.sqrt(np.sum(all_grads**2)), step=epoch)

            # Histogram bins
            counts, bin_edges = np.histogram(all_grads, bins=self.NUM_HISTOGRAM_BINS)
            if epoch == 0:
                _mlflow_client.log_param(f'{tower}_grad_hist_bin_edges', edges_str)
            for i, count in enumerate(counts):
                _mlflow_client.log_metric(f'{tower}_grad_hist_bin_{i}', int(count), step=epoch)

        # Clear for next epoch
        self.model._gradient_stats = dict(query=[], candidate=[])
```

**New Metrics Logged:**

| Metric | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `{tower}_grad_mean` | Metric | Mean gradient value per epoch |
| `{tower}_grad_std` | Metric | Gradient standard deviation |
| `{tower}_grad_min` | Metric | Minimum gradient value |
| `{tower}_grad_max` | Metric | Maximum gradient value |
| `{tower}_grad_norm` | Metric | L2 norm of gradients |
| `{tower}_grad_hist_bin_edges` | Parameter | Comma-separated bin edges (26 values) |
| `{tower}_grad_hist_bin_{0-24}` | Metric | Bin counts per epoch |

**UI Enhancement:**

```

#### Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `ml_platform/configs/services.py` | Added `_gradient_stats` storage, custom `train_step()` in RetrievalModel, new `GradientStatsCallback` |
| `ml_platform/experiments/mlflow_service.py` | Added `gradient_stats` parsing in `get_training_history()` |
| `templates/ml_platform/model_experiments.html` | Added Weights/Gradients dropdown, dynamic chart title and x-axis label |

#### Gradient Interpretation Guide

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Stable, centered at 0 | Healthy training |
| Narrowing to zero | Vanishing gradients - reduce regularization |
| Spreading out | Exploding gradients - add gradient clipping, lower LR |
| Spike at exactly 0 | Dead ReLU neurons - use LeakyReLU |
| Shift away from 0 | Bias in updates - check data/architecture |

#### Backward Compatibility

- **Existing experiments**: Show "Gradient histogram data not available" placeholder
- **New experiments**: Collect and display both weight and gradient histograms
- **Default selection**: Weights (preserves current behavior)

### MLflow Training Metrics Enhancement (2025-12-25)

**Major Enhancement:** Expanded training metrics collection and visualization in the Training tab.

#### The Problem

1. **Recall metrics not logged** - Bug in `_evaluate_recall_on_test_set` caused `TypeError: unhashable type: 'numpy.ndarray'` when building product ID lookup dictionary
2. **Limited loss visualization** - Only training and validation loss shown, not regularization or total loss
3. **No weight monitoring** - No visibility into weight norms or distributions during training
4. **Gradient norms missing** - Couldn't detect vanishing/exploding gradients

#### Changes Made

**1. Fixed Recall Evaluation Bug**

The `_precompute_candidate_embeddings` and `_evaluate_recall_on_test_set` functions now properly convert numpy arrays to Python scalars:

```python
# Fixed: Handle numpy arrays with extra dimensions and convert to Python scalars
if len(batch_ids.shape) > 1:
    batch_ids = batch_ids.flatten()
for b in batch_ids:
    if hasattr(b, 'decode'):
        converted_ids.append(b.decode())  # Bytes -> string
    elif hasattr(b, 'item'):
        converted_ids.append(b.item())    # Numpy scalar -> Python scalar
    else:
        converted_ids.append(b)           # Already Python type
```

**2. Added Training Callbacks**

Two new Keras callbacks log weight statistics to MLflow:

| Callback | Metrics Logged | Purpose |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| `WeightNormCallback` | `weight_norm`, `query_weight_norm`, `candidate_weight_norm` | Detect weight explosion/collapse |
| `WeightStatsCallback` | `{tower}_weights_mean/std/min/max` | Monitor weight distributions per tower |

**Tower Categorization Logic:**
- Query tower: variables with `'query'` OR `'buyer'` in name
- Candidate tower: variables with `'candidate'` OR `'product'` in name

**3. Enhanced MLflow Service**

`get_training_history()` now returns:

```python
{
    'loss': {
        'train': [...],           # Per-epoch
        'val': [...],
        'regularization': [...],
        'val_regularization': [...],
        'total': [...],
        'val_total': [...]
    },
    'gradient': {
        'total': [...],           # Per-epoch weight norms
        'query': [...],
        'candidate': [...]
    },
    'weight_stats': {
        'query': {'mean': [...], 'std': [...], 'min': [...], 'max': [...]},
        'candidate': {'mean': [...], 'std': [...], 'min': [...], 'max': [...]}
    },
    'final_metrics': {
        'test_loss': ...,
        'test_recall_at_10': ...,
        'test_recall_at_50': ...,
        'test_recall_at_100': ...,
        ...
    }
}
```

**4. Updated Training Tab UI**

New 4-chart layout with final metrics table:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│ └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Chart Features:**
- **Loss chart**: Toggle legend to show/hide individual loss components
- **Recall chart**: Bar chart (not line) since recall is only calculated at end
- **Weight norms**: Shows training stability over epochs
- **Weight distribution**: Dropdown to switch between Query and Candidate tower stats

#### Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `ml_platform/configs/services.py` | Fixed recall bug, added `WeightNormCallback`, added `WeightStatsCallback`, registered callbacks in run_fn |
| `ml_platform/experiments/mlflow_service.py` | Updated `get_training_history()` to include all loss variants, weight norms, weight stats |
| `templates/ml_platform/model_experiments.html` | Added 4 new charts (Loss enhanced, Recall bar, Weight norms, Weight distribution), Final metrics table, CSS for new components |

#### Backward Compatibility

- **Existing experiments**: Will show placeholders ("data not available") for new metrics (weight norms, weight stats)
- **New experiments**: Will collect and display all new metrics

#### Bug Fixes (2025-12-25)

Two bugs were discovered and fixed during initial testing:

**1. Missing numpy import**
```
NameError: name 'np' is not defined
File "trainer_module.py", line 833, in on_epoch_end
    _mlflow_client.log_metric('weight_norm', float(np.sqrt(total_norm_sq)), step=epoch)
```
**Fix:** Added `import numpy as np` to `_generate_imports()` method.

**2. Dict literal syntax in generated code**
```
TypeError: unhashable type: 'dict'
File "trainer_module.py", line 852, in on_epoch_end
    tower_stats = {{'query': [], 'candidate': []}}
```
**Cause:** Double braces `{{}}` in Python string templates escape to single braces, but the generated code `{{'query': []}}` is interpreted as a **set literal** containing a dict (not a dict literal). Sets require hashable elements, but dicts are unhashable.

**Fix:** Changed to `dict()` constructor and string concatenation:
```python
# Before (broken)
tower_stats = {{'query': [], 'candidate': []}}
_mlflow_client.log_metric(f'{{tower}}_weights_mean', ...)

# After (fixed)
tower_stats = dict(query=[], candidate=[])
_mlflow_client.log_metric(tower + '_weights_mean', ...)
```

### Compare Feature Redesign (2025-12-24)

**Major Enhancement:** Redesigned experiment comparison with two-step modal flow and comprehensive grouped comparison tables.

#### The Problem

The old compare feature had several UX issues:
1. Compare button was hidden until experiments were checkbox-selected from cards
2. Users couldn't see all available experiments at once
3. Comparison table lacked detail (no feature lists, no dataset info, no visual indicators)

#### The Solution

**1. Always-Visible Compare Button**
- Compare button in Quick Test chapter header is now always visible
- Clicking opens the Selection Modal (instead of requiring pre-selection)

**2. Selection Modal**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Select Experiments to Compare                      [X]  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Select 2-5 experiments                    3 selected   │
│  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐│
│  │ ☑ Exp #12 • Testing Q4 feat...  completed   47.3%  ││
│  │ ☑ Exp #11 • Baseline with...    completed   45.1%  ││
│  │ ☑ Exp #9  • Failed debug        failed      —      ││
│  │ ☐ Exp #8  • Another test        completed   43.2%  ││
│  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘│
│  [Clear All]                    [Cancel]  [Compare (3)] │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- Scrollable list of all experiments (completed, failed, cancelled)
- Each row shows: experiment number, name, description (30 chars), status badge, Recall@100
- Checkbox selection with 5-experiment limit
- Selected rows get yellow highlight
- Rows disabled (greyed out) when 5 already selected

**3. Enhanced Comparison Modal**
```
│ DATASET                                                 │
│ Name              │ Q4 Data    ≡ │ Q4 Data      │ Q4 Data    │

│ Recall@100        │ 47.3% ★     │ 45.1%        │ —          │
```

- **Grouped sections**: Results, Training Parameters, Sampling, Dataset, Feature Config, Model Config
- **Row indicators**: ≡ (identical values across all), ≠ (values differ)
- **Best value highlighting**: ★ with green color for best metrics
- **Feature lists**: Shows actual features like "user_id(64d), city(16d)" instead of just counts
- **Cross features**: Formatted as "user_id×city(16d)"
- **Tower layers**: Formatted as "256→128→64"

#### New API Endpoint

**GET /api/experiments/selectable/**

Returns experiments available for comparison (excludes running/submitting/pending):

```json

### MLflow Trainer Integration Fix (2025-12-24)

**Critical Fix:** Resolved 2-day issue where Vertex AI Trainer failed to communicate with MLflow server, resulting in experiments completing without any training metrics.

#### The Problem

The trainer component running on Vertex AI could not reliably send metrics to the MLflow server on Cloud Run. Experiments would complete successfully (model trained, metrics.json written), but the MLflow training history was empty. This made it impossible to visualize per-epoch training curves in the UI.

**Root Cause Analysis:**

| Issue | Description | Impact |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Cold Start Timeout** | MLflow server (Cloud Run, min-instances=0) takes 12-30s to cold start. Trainer used 10s timeout. | First request always failed |
| **Silent Failure** | Trainer caught MLflow exceptions, logged warning, set `_mlflow_client = None`, and continued training | Training succeeded but no metrics logged |
| **No Validation** | Trainer didn't verify MLflow was ready before starting training | Wasted hour-long experiments |
| **Cascading Failure** | When `set_experiment()` timed out, `experiment_id = None`, causing `runs/create` to return HTTP 400 | All subsequent MLflow calls failed |

**Evidence from Failed Experiment (qt-47):**
```
13:47:56 - MLflow: Got identity token via google-auth
13:48:26 - MLflow set_experiment error: The read operation timed out  ← 10s timeout expired
13:48:29 - MLflow API error (runs/create): HTTP 400 - Bad Request    ← No experiment_id!
13:48:29 - MLflow run started: None                                   ← run_id = None
```

Server-side (MLflow Cloud Run) responded 2 seconds AFTER client timeout:
```
15:48:16.786 - GET experiments/get-by-name returned 404 in 12.2s
15:48:26.222 - Gunicorn started (10 seconds after cold start)
```

#### The Fix

**1. Added `wait_for_ready()` method to MLflowRestClient**

The trainer now explicitly waits for MLflow server to be ready before attempting any operations:

```python
def wait_for_ready(self, max_wait_seconds=120):
    """Wait for MLflow server to be ready (handles cold starts)."""
    # Pings /health endpoint with exponential backoff
    # 60s timeout on first attempt, 30s after
    # Logs detailed progress for debugging
    # Raises RuntimeError if server not ready after 120s
```

**2. Made MLflow Mandatory**

Instead of silently continuing when MLflow fails, training now fails fast:

```python
# Before (broken):
try:
    _mlflow_client.set_experiment(...)
except Exception as e:
    logging.warning(f"MLflow failed: {e}")
    _mlflow_client = None  # Training continues without MLflow!

# After (fixed):
_mlflow_client.wait_for_ready(max_wait_seconds=120)
experiment_id = _mlflow_client.set_experiment(...)
if not experiment_id:
    raise RuntimeError("Failed to create experiment. Training cannot proceed.")
```

**3. Added Diagnostic Artifact (`mlflow_status.json`)**

Trainer writes status to GCS at each stage so Django can diagnose failures:

```json
{
  "status": "ready",
  "stage": "initialized",
  "experiment_id": "5",
  "run_id": "1193c2eba3aa4b86b21390ae67cde4de",
  "message": "MLflow fully initialized, training may proceed"
}
```

**4. Added Comprehensive Logging**

Trainer now logs exactly what's happening during MLflow connection:

```
--------------------------------------------------
MLFLOW CONNECTION: Starting server health check
  Server URL: https://mlflow-server-xxx.run.app
  Max wait time: 120s
--------------------------------------------------
MLFLOW CONNECTION: Attempt 1
  Elapsed: 0.0s | Remaining: 120.0s
  Getting authentication token...
  Auth token obtained: True
  Sending health check request (timeout=60s)...
  TIMEOUT - Server may be experiencing cold start
  Waiting 5s before next attempt...
MLFLOW CONNECTION: Attempt 2
  ...
  Response received: HTTP 200
  Request time: 15.32s
--------------------------------------------------
MLFLOW CONNECTION: SUCCESS after 20.3s (2 attempts)
--------------------------------------------------
```

**5. Added MLflow Server Request Logging**

Updated `mlflow_server/Dockerfile` to log all requests with timing:

```dockerfile
CMD mlflow server \
    --gunicorn-opts "--access-logfile - --access-logformat '%(t)s %(h)s %(m)s %(U)s %(s)s %(D)sms' --timeout 120"
```

**6. Created Integration Test Script**

`tests/test_mlflow_integration.py` - Run before experiments to verify MLflow works:

```bash
python tests/test_mlflow_integration.py
```

#### Files Modified

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `ml_platform/configs/services.py` | Added `wait_for_ready()`, mandatory MLflow, diagnostic artifact, comprehensive logging |
| `ml_platform/experiments/artifact_service.py` | Added `get_mlflow_status()` to read diagnostics |
| `mlflow_server/Dockerfile` | Added Gunicorn access logging and 120s timeout |
| `tests/test_mlflow_integration.py` | New standalone verification script |

#### Verification

First successful experiment with fix (qt-48, Exp #17):

**Trainer Logs:**
- Health check: SUCCESS after cold start wait
- Experiment created: id=5
- Run started: id=1193c2eba3aa4b86b21390ae67cde4de
- All 60+ metrics logged (HTTP 200)

**MLflow Server Logs:**
```
16:22:40 | GET /health                  → 200 (1.4s)
16:22:41 | POST /experiments/create     → 200 (27s)
16:22:41 | POST /runs/create            → 200 (34s)
16:22:42 | POST /runs/log-parameter ×8  → 200
16:22:43 | POST /runs/set-tag ×4        → 200
16:22:49 | POST /runs/log-metric ×60+   → 200
16:23:17 | POST /runs/update            → 200
```

**UI Result:** Training curves now visible in View modal → Training tab.

### Known Issue: Cloud SQL Performance (2025-12-24)

**Problem:** MLflow server response times are very slow (15-30 seconds per request).

**Root Cause:** Cloud SQL instance is `db-f1-micro` (smallest tier):
- 0.6 GB RAM (barely enough for PostgreSQL)
- Shared vCPU (competes with other tenants)
- Each metric INSERT takes 15-30s due to resource starvation

**Impact:**
- Training with 60+ metric calls takes extra ~20 minutes just for MLflow logging
- Django UI is slow when loading training history
- Worker timeouts during cold start (13 workers crashed in first 12 minutes)

**MLflow Server Logs Showing Worker Crashes:**
```
15:49:35 | CRITICAL WORKER TIMEOUT (pid:11)
15:49:37 | Worker was sent SIGKILL! Perhaps out of memory?
... (repeated 13 times over 12 minutes)
```

**Recommendations:**

| Option | Change | Cost Impact | Expected Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Upgrade Cloud SQL** | `db-f1-micro` → `db-g1-small` | +$18/month | 3-5x faster |
| **Batch Metrics** | Use `/runs/log-batch` endpoint | None | Fewer API calls |
| **Increase Workers** | 2 → 4 workers with threads | None | Better concurrency |

**Upgrade Command:**
```bash
gcloud sql instances patch b2b-recs-db --tier=db-g1-small --project=b2b-recs
```

**Status:** Not addressed yet. System is functional but slow.

### Pipeline DAG Static File Extraction (2025-12-22)

**Major Enhancement:** Extracted pipeline DAG visualization into reusable static files for use on future Full Training page.

**Files Created:**
- `static/css/pipeline_dag.css` - 293 lines of DAG styles
- `static/js/pipeline_dag.js` - ~500 lines of DAG rendering logic
- `templates/includes/_pipeline_dag.html` - Reusable HTML template

**Key Benefits:**
1. **Reusability** - Same visualization component for Quick Test and Full Training pages
2. **Maintainability** - Single source of truth for DAG styling and logic
3. **Django Best Practices** - Proper separation into static files and includes

**Usage:**
```django
{% include 'includes/_pipeline_dag.html' %}
<script src="{% static 'js/pipeline_dag.js' %}?v=1"></script>
```

**Note:** Template documentation uses HTML comments instead of Django comments because Django parses template tags even inside `{# #}` comments.

### Enhanced Pipeline DAG Visualization (2025-12-22)

**Major Enhancement:** Complete TFX pipeline visualization with 8 nodes and 11 artifacts.

**Key Features:**
1. **8-Node Pipeline** - Pipeline Compile, Examples Gen, Stats Gen, Schema Gen, Transform, Trainer, Evaluator, Pusher
2. **11 Artifacts Displayed** - Config, Examples, Statistics, Schema, Transform Graph, Transformed Examples, Model, ModelRun, Model Blessing, Evaluation, Model Endpoint
3. **Bezier Curve Connections** - SVG curves with 4 types (left, right, down-left, down-right)
4. **Visual Improvements** - White background with subtle dots, 264px node width, consistent spacing

**Node Renaming:**
- BigQueryExampleGen → Examples Gen
- StatisticsGen → Stats Gen
- SchemaGen → Schema Gen

### Schema Fix & TFDV Hybrid Visualization (2025-12-21)

**Problems Solved:**
1. **Schema Tab Bug** - Schema showed "UNKNOWN" for all feature types and "No" for all required fields
2. **TFDV Modal Display Issues** - TFDV iframe modal rendered incorrectly (cramped, font errors, nested iframes)

**Root Causes:**
1. Field name mismatch: Backend returned `feature_type`/`presence`, frontend expected `type`/`required`
2. TFDV uses Google Facets which creates triple-nested iframes and loads external dependencies from GitHub - impossible to style from parent page

**Solutions:**
1. **Schema Fix** - Updated `renderSchema()` to use correct field names:
   ```javascript
   <td>${f.feature_type || 'UNKNOWN'}</td>
   <td>${f.presence === 'required' ? 'Yes' : 'No'}</td>
   ```

2. **Hybrid TFDV Approach**:
   - **Removed** broken iframe modal (`#tfdvModal`, `showTfdvVisualization()`, `closeTfdvModal()`)
   - **Kept** working custom statistics display (histograms, top values, distribution bars)
   - **Added** "Open Full Report" button that opens TFDV in a new browser tab

**New Endpoint:**
- `GET /experiments/quick-tests/{id}/tfdv/` - Serves TFDV HTML as standalone page

**Key Changes:**
- Button changed from `<button onclick>` to `<a target="_blank">` (avoids popup blockers)
- TFDV HTML wrapped in proper page with header and styling
- Users can inspect full interactive TFDV report in a new tab

### TFDV Parser Cloud Run Service (2025-12-20)

**Problem Solved:** Data Insights tab was showing "Statistics not yet available" because Django (Python 3.12) couldn't import `tensorflow-metadata` due to protobuf version conflicts with google-cloud packages.

**Solution:** Created a dedicated Cloud Run microservice (`tfdv-parser`) running Python 3.10 with full TFX/TFDV stack.

**Key Features:**
1. **Microservice Architecture** - Separates TensorFlow dependencies from Django
2. **Rich Statistics Display** - Matches standard TFDV visualization format
   - Numeric: count, missing%, mean, std_dev, zeros%, min, median, max, histograms
   - Categorical: count, missing%, unique, top values, distribution charts
3. **TFDV HTML Visualization** - "View Full TFDV Report" button for complete TFDV interactive display
4. **Cloud Run Service-to-Service Auth** - IAM-based authentication between Django and tfdv-parser

**Service Details:**
- URL: `https://tfdv-parser-3dmqemfmxq-lm.a.run.app`
- Endpoints: `/parse/statistics`, `/parse/schema`, `/parse/statistics/html`

### Pipeline DAG Visualization with Component Logs (2025-12-20)

**Major Enhancement:**

1. **Vertical DAG Layout** - Visual pipeline representation matching Vertex AI Pipelines style
   - 4-row structure: Examples → Stats/Schema → Transform → Train

3. **Color-Coded Status** - Component status at a glance
   - Grey outline: Pending
   - Orange fill: Running (animated pulse)
   - Green fill: Completed successfully
   - Red fill: Failed

4. **Technical Implementation**
   - New endpoint: `GET /api/quick-tests/{id}/logs/{component}/`
   - Uses Google Cloud Logging Python client
   - Extracts task job IDs from Vertex AI pipeline task details
   - IAM requirement: `roles/logging.viewer` for service account

### View Modal Redesign with Tabs & Artifacts (2025-12-19)

**Major Redesign:**

1. **4-Tab Modal Layout** - Clean tabbed interface replacing cluttered boxes
   - **Overview Tab**: Status, configuration, training params, results
   - **Pipeline Tab**: 6-stage progress bar with stage-by-stage status
   - **Data Insights Tab**: Dataset statistics + inferred schema (lazy-loaded)
   - **Training Tab**: Training curves placeholder (for future MLflow integration)

2. **Error Pattern Matching** - Smart error classification with fix suggestions
   - 15+ patterns for common failures (memory, schema, BigQuery, timeout, etc.)
   - User-friendly error titles instead of raw stack traces
   - Actionable suggestions (e.g., "Try reducing batch_size or selecting larger hardware")

3. **Artifact Visibility** - View pipeline artifacts without GCP access
   - Statistics: Feature count, missing %, min/max/mean values
   - Schema: Feature names, types, required/optional
   - Lazy-loaded on tab switch (not on modal open)

4. **Hidden GCP Details** - Users only see Django app
   - Removed Vertex AI links (users can't access)
   - Removed GCS paths (users can't access)
   - All artifact data parsed and displayed in-app

### Experiment View Modal (2025-12-19)

**New Features:**

1. **Comprehensive View Modal** - Click experiment card or View button to see full details
   - Configuration: Feature Config, Model Config, Dataset
   - Training Parameters: Epochs, Batch Size, LR, Sample %, Split Strategy, Hardware
   - Pipeline Progress: 6-stage progress bar with real-time updates
   - Results: Loss, Recall@10/50/100, Vocabulary statistics
   - Error Section: Classified error with suggestions for failed experiments

2. **View Button** - Green button on experiment cards (above Cancel)
   - Opens the View modal with full experiment details
   - Alternative to clicking the card itself

3. **Real-time Updates** - View modal polls for updates on running experiments
   - Updates every 10 seconds
   - Auto-stops polling when experiment completes

4. **Styled Confirmation Dialog** - Cancel now uses styled modal instead of browser confirm()
   - Matches the design of confirmation dialogs elsewhere in the app

5. **Unified Backend Logging** - All experiment logs now show `Exp #N (id=X)` format
   - Makes it easier to correlate UI and server logs

### Experiment Cards Redesign & Cancel (2025-12-19)

**New Features:**

1. **Experiment Name & Description** - Optional fields to identify experiments
   - Name and Description fields in Step 1 of New Experiment wizard
   - Displayed on experiment cards (description truncated to 50 chars)

2. **Cancel Running Experiments** - Cancel button on every experiment card
   - Active (red) for running/submitting experiments
   - Disabled (light red) for completed/failed/cancelled
   - Calls `aiplatform.PipelineJob.cancel()` via Vertex AI SDK

3. **4-Column Card Layout** - Better information organization
   - Column 1 (30%): Exp #, Name, Description, Start/End times
   - Column 2 (20%): Dataset, Features, Model
   - Column 3 (30%): Training params (placeholder)
   - Column 4 (20%): View button, Cancel button

4. **Progress Bar Styling** - Tensor-breakdown-bar style
   - 24px height with labels inside
   - Gradient green colors for completed stages
   - Animated blue for running, red for failed

### Page Split from Configs Domain (2025-12-13)

**Major Change:** Quick Test functionality moved from Configs page to dedicated Experiments page.

**Why This Change:**
- `model_configs.html` exceeded 10,000 lines
- Running experiments and analyzing experiments deserve dedicated space
- Clear separation: Configs = Configure features/architecture, Experiments = Run and compare

**New UI Structure:**
- **Experiments Page** (`model_experiments.html`) now handles:
  - Feature Config + Model Config selection
  - Training parameters configuration
  - Quick Test execution and monitoring
  - Future: MLflow experiment comparison

**How Experiments Page Works:**
1. User selects Feature Config from dropdown
2. User selects Model Config from dropdown (determines architecture)
3. Training parameters (epochs, batch size, learning rate) auto-fill from ModelConfig
4. Click "Start Quick Test" to submit pipeline to Vertex AI
5. Monitor progress in real-time
6. View results when complete

---

## Overview

### Purpose
The Experiments domain allows users to:
1. **Run Quick Tests** to validate feature configurations on Vertex AI Pipelines
2. Compare Quick Test and Full Training results across configurations
3. Visualize metrics via heatmaps (Recall@k by configuration parameters)
4. Identify the best-performing configurations
5. Track experiment history and decisions

### Key Principle
**MLflow is for comparison and visualization, ML Metadata is for lineage.** Users use MLflow heatmaps to answer "which config is best?", while MLMD answers "what exact artifacts produced this model?".

### Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Quick Test** | A lightweight training run (10% data, 2-3 epochs) for rapid validation |
| **Full Training** | Complete training run with all data and more epochs |
| **Feature Config** | Configuration of how columns are transformed (from Configs domain) |
| **Model Config** | Neural network architecture configuration (from Configs domain) |

### Tool Responsibilities

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **MLflow** | Experiment tracking, metrics comparison, heatmaps, parameter search visualization |
| **ML Metadata (MLMD)** | Artifact lineage, schema versions, vocabulary tracking, production model registry |

---

## Quick Test

### Overview

Quick Test runs a mini TFX pipeline on Vertex AI to validate feature configurations before committing to full training:

### Quick Test vs Full Training

| Aspect | Quick Test | Full Training |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| Data | 5-100% sample (configurable) | 100% data |
| ExampleGen | Sampled BigQuery | Full BigQuery |
| StatisticsGen/Transform | Dataflow (auto-scaling) | Dataflow (auto-scaling) |
| Trainer | CPU (configurable tiers) | GPU, 10-50 epochs |
| Hardware | Small/Medium/Large CPU tiers | GPU-enabled instances |
| Output | Temporary | Permanent artifacts |
| MLflow | Logged (tagged as quick test) | Logged (production) |

### Pipeline Integration

Full Vertex AI Pipeline integration for validating feature configurations:

**Backend:**
- `QuickTest` model in `ml_platform/models.py` - Tracks pipeline runs with status, progress, results
- `ml_platform/pipelines/` module - New sub-app for pipeline management:
  - `services.py` - PipelineService class for submission, polling, result extraction
  - `pipeline_builder.py` - KFP v2 pipeline with 6 components (ExampleGen, StatisticsGen, SchemaGen, Transform, Trainer, SaveMetrics)
  - `api.py` - 4 REST endpoints for start/status/cancel/list operations
- GCS buckets with lifecycle policies (7/30/3 days)
- IAM roles configured for `django-app` service account

**Pipeline Flow:**
```
FeatureConfig + ModelConfig → Dataset → BigQueryService.generate_query() → Vertex AI Pipeline → metrics.json → UI
```

### Quick Test API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/feature-configs/{id}/quick-test/` | Start quick test with configurable epochs, batch size, learning rate |
| GET | `/api/quick-tests/{id}/` | Get status and results (auto-polls Vertex AI) |
| POST | `/api/quick-tests/{id}/cancel/` | Cancel running pipeline |
| GET | `/api/feature-configs/{id}/quick-tests/` | List all tests for a config |

**Machine Type Tiers:**

| Tier | Machine Type | vCPU | Memory | Recommended For |
|------|--------------|------|--------|-----------------|
| Small | n1-standard-4 | 4 | 15 GB | Datasets < 100K rows |
| Medium | n1-standard-8 | 8 | 30 GB | Datasets 100K - 1M rows |
| Large | n1-standard-16 | 16 | 60 GB | Datasets > 1M rows |

**Auto-Recommendation:** The system automatically suggests hardware based on dataset size and model complexity.

**Dataflow Integration:** StatisticsGen and Transform components always use Dataflow with the selected machine type for worker nodes. This ensures scalable processing for large datasets.

### Django Models (Lightweight)

Most experiment data lives in MLflow. Django stores minimal reference data:

```python
# ml_platform/models.py

class ExperimentComparison(models.Model):
    """
    Saved comparison for reference.
    """
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    ml_model = models.ForeignKey('MLModel', on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    # MLflow run IDs being compared
    mlflow_run_ids = models.JSONField(default=list)

    # Notes
    notes = models.TextField(blank=True)

    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    created_by = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)
```

## MLflow Server Setup

### Cloud Run Deployment

MLflow server runs as a Cloud Run service per client project:

```yaml
# mlflow-server/cloudbuild.yaml
steps:
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'

### Phase 13: Experiment Cards Redesign & Cancel ✅ DONE (2025-12-19)
> **Improved card layout and cancel functionality**

- [x] **4-column layout**: Exp info (30%), Config (20%), Params placeholder (30%), Actions (20%)
- [x] **Experiment name/description**: Optional fields in New Experiment wizard Step 1
- [x] **Cancel button**: Active for running experiments, disabled for others
- [x] **Progress bar styling**: Tensor-breakdown-bar with gradient green colors
- [x] **Styled confirmation**: Cancel uses styled modal instead of browser confirm()

**Result:** Experiment cards show more information in organized columns with cancel functionality.

### Phase 14: Experiment View Modal ✅ DONE (2025-12-19)
> **Comprehensive experiment details modal**

- [x] **View modal**: Full experiment details (config, params, progress, results, technical details)
- [x] **View button**: Green button on cards, opens View modal
- [x] **Real-time polling**: View modal updates every 10s for running experiments

**Result:** Data Insights tab shows comprehensive TFDV statistics matching the standard visualization format.

### Phase 19: Schema Fix & TFDV Hybrid Visualization ✅ DONE (2025-12-21)
> **Bug fixes for Schema tab and improved TFDV display approach**

- [x] **Schema field name fix**: Updated `renderSchema()` to use `feature_type` and `presence` instead of `type` and `required`
- [x] **Removed broken TFDV modal**: Deleted iframe-based `#tfdvModal` HTML, CSS (~80 lines), and JavaScript functions

- [x] **Consistent spacing**: Equal vertical spacing (~174px) between all pipeline stages
- [x] **Node renaming**: BigQueryExampleGen → Examples Gen, StatisticsGen → Stats Gen, SchemaGen → Schema Gen
- [x] **New icons**: Trainer uses fa-microchip, Evaluator uses fa-check-double, Pusher uses fa-cloud-upload-alt
- [x] **Direct Model → Pusher path**: Alternative deployment path without Evaluator

**Result:** Pipeline visualization matches Vertex AI Pipelines console style with complete TFX component and artifact representation.

### Phase 21: Pipeline DAG Static File Extraction ✅ DONE (2025-12-22)
> **Reusable DAG visualization components for Full Training page**

- [x] **CSS extraction**: Created `static/css/pipeline_dag.css` with all DAG styles (293 lines)
- [x] **JS extraction**: Created `static/js/pipeline_dag.js` with DAG rendering logic (~500 lines)
- [x] **HTML template**: Created `templates/includes/_pipeline_dag.html` as reusable include
- [x] **model_experiments.html update**: Added imports, replaced inline code with includes
- [x] **HTML comments for docs**: Use `<!-- -->` instead of `{# #}` (Django parses tags in Django comments)
- [x] **Global functions preserved**: `renderPipelineStages()`, `selectDagComponent()`, `loadComponentLogs()`, etc.

**Result:** Pipeline DAG visualization is now a reusable component that can be included on both Quick Test and Full Training pages.

### Phase 22: Dataflow Zone Fix & Column Alias Filter Support ✅ DONE (2025-12-30)
> **Fix Dataflow zone exhaustion and add column alias support in SQL filters**

- [x] **Dataflow zone configuration**: Added explicit `--zone={region}-b` to beam_pipeline_args to avoid exhausted zones
- [x] **Zone exhaustion diagnosis**: Identified `europe-central2-a` and `europe-central2-c` as exhausted zones causing BigQueryExampleGen failures
- [x] **Column alias translation helper**: Added `_translate_column_to_alias()` method in `datasets/services.py`
- [x] **Product filter alias support**: Updated `_generate_product_filter_clauses_v2()` to translate column names when querying `filtered_data` CTE
- [x] **Customer filter alias support**: Updated `_generate_customer_filter_clauses_v2()` similarly
- [x] **BigQueryExampleGen isolated test**: Created `tests/test_bq_example_gen.py` for testing BigQueryExampleGen independently

**Files Changed:**
- `ml_platform/experiments/services.py`: Added `--zone={region}-b` to Dataflow beam_pipeline_args (line 650)
- `ml_platform/datasets/services.py`: Added `_translate_column_to_alias()` helper and updated filter functions
- `tests/test_bq_example_gen.py`: New isolated test for BigQueryExampleGen with column aliases

**Note:** The column alias translation in product/customer filters may not have been strictly necessary for the tested dataset (Dataset 14). Further testing is needed with datasets that use product_filter or customer_filter configurations with aliased columns to confirm these changes are required.

**Result:** QuickTest #58 succeeded after zone fix. Experiments using Dataset 14 with column aliases now complete successfully.

### Phase 23: Gradient Statistics MLflow Logging ✅ DONE (2025-12-31)
> **Fix graph-mode gradient collection and add histogram logging to MLflow**

**Problem:** Training failed with `AttributeError: 'SymbolicTensor' object has no attribute 'numpy'` in the custom `train_step`. The gradient collection code was calling `.numpy()` inside `train_step`, which runs in TensorFlow graph mode where tensors are symbolic.

**Root Cause:** The `train_step` method is traced by TensorFlow and runs in graph mode, not eager mode. Calling `.numpy()` on symbolic tensors is not allowed.

**Solution:** Implemented `tf.Variable` accumulators that are updated with pure TensorFlow operations in `train_step`, then read in the eager-mode callback (`on_epoch_end`).

**Changes to `ml_platform/configs/services.py`:**

1. **RetrievalModel `__init__`** (lines 2274-2286): Changed from Python dict to `tf.Variable` accumulators:
   ```python
   self._grad_accum = {}
   for tower in ['query', 'candidate']:
       self._grad_accum[tower] = {
           'sum': tf.Variable(0.0, trainable=False, name=f'{tower}_grad_sum'),
           'sum_sq': tf.Variable(0.0, trainable=False, name=f'{tower}_grad_sum_sq'),
           'count': tf.Variable(0.0, trainable=False, name=f'{tower}_grad_count'),
           'min': tf.Variable(float('inf'), trainable=False, name=f'{tower}_grad_min'),
           'max': tf.Variable(float('-inf'), trainable=False, name=f'{tower}_grad_max'),
           'hist_counts': tf.Variable(tf.zeros(25, dtype=tf.int32), ...),
       }
   ```

2. **`train_step`** (lines 2313-2363): Uses pure TF ops for gradient accumulation:
   ```python
   accum['sum'].assign_add(tf.reduce_sum(grad_flat))
   accum['sum_sq'].assign_add(tf.reduce_sum(tf.square(grad_flat)))
   accum['count'].assign_add(tf.cast(tf.size(grad_flat), tf.float32))
   accum['min'].assign(tf.minimum(accum['min'], tf.reduce_min(grad_flat)))
   accum['max'].assign(tf.maximum(accum['max'], tf.reduce_max(grad_flat)))
   hist = tf.histogram_fixed_width(grad_clipped, [-1.0, 1.0], nbins=25)
   accum['hist_counts'].assign_add(hist)
   ```

3. **`GradientStatsCallback.on_epoch_end`** (lines 2814-2867): Reads `tf.Variable` values (which works in eager callback context), computes statistics, logs to MLflow, and resets accumulators.

4. **Template escaping fix**: Since `services.py` is a code generator template, curly braces must be escaped (`{{` and `}}`) for literal braces in f-strings. For metric names, changed from f-strings to string concatenation:
   ```python
   # Wrong (breaks in template):
   _mlflow_client.log_metric(f'{tower}_grad_hist_bin_{i}', ...)

   # Correct:
   _mlflow_client.log_metric(tower + '_grad_hist_bin_' + str(i), ...)
   ```

**New Files:**
- `scripts/test_services_trainer.py`: Standalone Custom Job test that uses actual `services.py` code generation
- `scripts/run_trainer_only.py`: Custom Job test with regex patching (for testing existing trainer code)
- `docs/custom_job_test.md`: Documentation for running standalone Custom Jobs

**MLflow Metrics Added:**
- `{tower}_grad_mean` - Mean gradient value per tower
- `{tower}_grad_std` - Standard deviation of gradients
- `{tower}_grad_min` - Minimum gradient value
- `{tower}_grad_max` - Maximum gradient value
- `{tower}_grad_norm` - L2 norm of gradients
- `{tower}_grad_hist_bin_{0-24}` - 25-bin histogram counts (range: -1.0 to 1.0)
- `{tower}_grad_hist_bin_edges` - Histogram bin edges (logged once as param)

**Testing:**
1. Created `scripts/test_services_trainer.py` to test actual code generation from `services.py`
2. Custom Job `1235854368155107328` succeeded with no HTTP 400 errors
3. Full pipeline experiment verified end-to-end

**Result:** Gradient statistics are now correctly collected during training and logged to MLflow for visualization in the Training tab.
